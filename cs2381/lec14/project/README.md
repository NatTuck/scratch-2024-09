# Computational complexity rules of thumb

Method does a constant number of constant time things:

 - It's O(1)

Method does one recursive call to the next item in a sequence
of N items.

 - It's O(n)

Method has a loop over N items.

 - It's O(n)


Method has a loop over N items, each iteration calls recursive method on the next
item of a size-N linked list?

 - O(n*n) = O(n^2)

```
for (list : lists) {
    list.size()
}
```
