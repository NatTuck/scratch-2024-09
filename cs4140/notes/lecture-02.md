## Agile Project Management

### Project Management

 - There's a project (a thing the business wants to get done)
 - Employees / contractors need to do the work
 - How?

Figuring out what you're doing:

 - "Requirements gathering"

### Waterfall

Agile consultants always start with a story about Waterfall.

Waterfall is a description of the engineering process to build a bridge.

 - First, figure out requirements.
 - Then the engineers and archetects design a bridge.
 - Then, you order the materials and schedule the workers.
 - Then they build the bridge.
 - Then you check they did what they were told.
 - Then you're done.

This can work for software:

 - Example: Aerospace control systems
 - Counterexample: 747 Max


### Agile Manifesto

Software projects should value:

 - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
 - Working software over comprehensive documention.
 - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
 - Responding to change over following a plan.

One key idea figured out later:

 - Fast iteration from working program to working program
   

### Kanban

This is a process developed at Toyota in the 1980's to build better cars.

Just like software, industrial manufacturing allows for learning.

A Kanban board is a way to visualize the manfacturing process.
