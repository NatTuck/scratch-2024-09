Practice App: Bad Date

Today's meeting (should get this stuff done in class):

 - Everyone should be on cs4140.party
 - Everyone create a Taiga.io account 
   - Set up a project & Kanban board for Bad Date
   - Add team and Prof. Tuck to project
 - Each team should create a Github organization
   - Give all team members permisisons 
   
If this overflows, note who's going to do confirm that y'all did in their
personal report today:

 - Someone get the Phoenix Framework set up on their laptop
   - https://www.phoenixframework.org/
   - Create new project (sqlite3 db)
   - Get it onto a Github repository owned by your org
 - Create stories for each team member adding their name to the readme.
   - Follow the process (fork, clone, local edit, feature branch, push, PR, review)
     to complete those stories.
