# Lecture 11 - Deploy and Meeting

Feature discussion for Bad Date:

 - What info can you collect to produce bad matches?
 - How do you score matches to determine how bad they are?
 - What sort of functionality does your app need?

Add some stock stories:

 - As a user, I should see matches and be able to react to them in some way.
 - As a user, I should be able to send messages to other users (under some circustances maybe?)
   and they should be able to see them.
 - As a user, I should be able to answer extra profile qeustion and then later edit my answers.
 - Need at least one more story to give every team member stuff to do.

I'll put up team report questions shortly.
