# Features for "Bad Date"

**First Story**

As a user, I'd like to be able to sign up, so I can see matches.

Simple traits: Gender, Looking for gender, Birth Date, Zip Code

 - Gender: Let's do the simple version to keep it simple: M/F
 - Looking for: One or both.
 - Birth date: Date, valid matches are +/- 5 years.
 - Zip code: Matches should be within 100 miles

TODO: Add this story to your Kanban board, start working on it.

**Further Thought**

Design question: If we want to satisfy the expectations for the simple traits,
what other information should we collect to succesfully accomplish our mission
statement of generating bad matches?

 - Do you like seafood?
 - Do you enjoy camping?
