# Lecture 12: More Features

**Story 1**

As a non-logged in user, I shouldn't be able to create an event.

When I try to create an event, it should give an error message.

Probably, the "New Event" button shouldn't even show up.

**Story 2**

As a logged in user, when I create an event, I should be the owner of that
event and should be solely able to modify and delete it.
